Eagle-Python AutoPlacer 

- How the AutoPlacer is going to check parts that have onBoard and/or offBoard parts??
   -- TODO: if the AutoPlacer has a unlocked part with an off board layer then exit with an error. 

 - TODO: Instead of use half of the size of the part as steps, use a predefined number of steps:(e.g 4)
